<h1> Project 1: Github Poetry</h1>

<p> "Uncle's Baking Caused Cravings" is the title of my poem. For this project, we had to write our poem based on the last text we had sent to someone. As a result, my poem was inspired by a text I sent my significant other, where I was talking to him about a bread my uncle had baked that looked delicious. </p>

<p> This project was special because it was the first time I got to really put into practice the html and css I learned from this class. The biggest accomplishment of this assignment was simply being able to execute the overall look of the web page.</p>
